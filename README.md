# pmerge R package

This package contains several functions to merge p-values that are either independent or arbitrarily dependent from multiple hypothesis testing.

## Installation

## Methods to merge p-values
This package contains the following functions/methods to merge p-values:
* The Generalized Mean Merging Function (pmean): It contains the generalized mean methods for independent p-values (Chen et al. 2020) and arbitrarily dependent p-values (Vovk and Wang (2020) and Vovk et al. (2020)).
* The Order Statistics Merging Function (porder): It contains the order statistics merging method (Vovk et al. 2020) for arbitrarily dependent p-values.
* The Harmonic Mean Merging Function (pharmonic): It contains the harmonic mean method (Wilson 2019) for independent p-values, the harmonic mean method (Vovk and Wang 2020) and the harmonic* merging method (Vovk et al. 2020) for arbitrarily depen- dent p-values.
* The Simes Merging Function (pSimes): It contains the Simes method (Simes 1986) for independent p-values, the Hommel method (Hommel 1983) and the grid harmonic merg- ing method (Vovk et al. 2020) for arbitrarily dependent p-values.
* The Cauchy Merging Function (pCauchy): It contains the Cauchy combination methods for independent p-values (Liu and Xie 2020) and arbitrarily dependent p-values (Chen et al. 2020).
